# PokedexLite
Developing test for the company Certant (Argentina)

With this app, you can see a list of the lastest pokemons (hardcoded) and the details for each pokemon (Name, current level, possible evolution).
As an Pokemon expert, you can edit the name and the current level of each pokemon.

## Note
This project uses Android Studio and it is tested on my own smartphone (Lenovo K6, API 24: Android 7.0 Nougat).
